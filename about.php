            <h2>TYE 2019 ~ About Us</h2>
                <p class="explainer">
                    Welcome to Session T.Y.E! Our session focuses on providing foster care youth with enriching outdoor adventures and invaluable mentorship, giving them opportunities to develop leadership skills and prepare for life after foster care. Session TYE believes that creating community and belonging is the first step to combating the challenges of foster care and promoting success.

                    Without the proper resources, foster kids are more likely to not receive a college degree-only 3% of all foster youth graduate college. Compare that with national rates of roughly 40% of the population having a degree. Transitional youth may lack the information necessary to know what they should do to make college more attainable. Sometimes individuals may prioritize getting these kids housing over giving them access to resources that help them get good grades, stay in school, and eventually get to college. With a solid pool of social capital, this can be partially remedied. This session incorporates many different types of programing outside of the normal camp activities to help provide an engaging and fun week of camp, such as scavenger hunts, open mic, self-care workshops, and more.

                    Issues faced by foster youth: Only about 2% of foster youth individuals will be adopted. From those that age out of the system, about fifty percent will become homeless, a third will become involved in criminal activity, and only 3% will move on to obtain a college education. For example, educational advocacy can be used to address a wide variety of logistical challenges related to achieving educational goals and can be implemented through volunteers or professionals, while mentoring can be implemented in a wide variety of ways to provide both emotional and instrumental support for achieving a variety of goals and can be implemented one-on-one, in groups, by peers, by community members, or in a host of other forms.

                    Social Capital: the networks of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively.
                    Also, information, influence, social credentials, and reinforcement. First, network ties can supply youth with important information about college that would otherwise be unavailable, either by providing information directly or linking youth to sources of information (e.g., assisting youth with technical aspects of the application process, referring youth to college guidebooks, and exploring viable options for financing college). Second, social ties can exert influence on youths’ decisions, such as the types of colleges that they choose to apply to (e.g., 2-year vs. 4-year, local vs. distant, public vs. private). Third, social ties can influence others’ investment of the time, assistance, and resources needed to get youth into college. Fourth, social ties can reinforce youths’ identities as future college students.
