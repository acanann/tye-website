                    Transitional youth refers to kids, usually those in their teens, who are transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, and are in the foster care system. Therefore, transitional youth and foster youth are essentially interchangeable terms. According to the William Institute, 10% of foster youth will attend college and only 3% of foster children receive a bachelor's degree. UniCamp has provided week long camp experiences to foster youth for many years now, however, there wasn’t always a focused initiative that addresses the education gap seen in foster youth.

                    UniCamp’s Transitional Youth Empowerment (T.Y.E.) session will focus on college readiness and attainability, but will also give them access to current and recently graduated college students who can answer questions about college. As the counselors become mentors, the campers can obtain the necessary tools to empower themselves through their education and have an easier transition out of the foster system.</p>

                    Session TYE inspires children from urban communities to envision brighter futures by sending them, along with our student volunteers, to its residential outdoor summer camp at Camp River Glen. Because of UniCamp, both volunteers and campers have a chance to: Lead, Play, Learn.
